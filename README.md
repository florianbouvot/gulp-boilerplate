## Getting Started

Note: if you've previously installed Gulp globally, run `yarn global remove gulp` to remove it. (Details here)[https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467].

Prerequisites : 
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * [Gulp Command Line Utility](http://gulpjs.com/)

1. In bash/terminal/command line, cd into your project directory.
2. Run `yarn install` to install required dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
  * `yarn dev` serve, watch for changes and automatically refresh across devices.
  * `yarn prod` build current project, ready for test or deployment.
